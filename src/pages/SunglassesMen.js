            while enhancing your overall appearance. Whether you’re hitting the
            beach or heading to a formal event, the right pair of sunglasses
            can make a lasting impression.

          <h2>Wide-Frame Designs</h2>
          <p>
            Wide-frame sunglasses are perfect for men with broader facial
            structures. These designs offer a bold and confident look that’s
            both modern and timeless. Wide frames also provide greater coverage,
            ensuring optimal eye protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Look for materials like acetate or metal to balance durability with
            comfort. Many brands now offer lightweight wide frames that don’t
            sacrifice style for practicality.

          <h2>Reflective Lenses</h2>
          <p>
            Reflective sunglasses are a trendy choice for men who want to stand
            out. These lenses reduce glare, making them ideal for outdoor
            activities like driving, fishing, or hiking. Available in a range of
            colors—gold, silver, blue, and more—reflective lenses add a stylish
            edge to any outfit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many reflective sunglasses come with polarized lenses, which offer
            additional glare reduction and better visual clarity, ensuring
            both style and performance.

            <li>
              <strong>Lens Type:</strong> Consider polarized lenses for outdoor
              use or mirrored options for a unique, stylish flair.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Material:</strong> Opt for lightweight materials like
              acetate for comfort during prolonged wear.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Occasion:</strong> Choose versatile black frames for
              formal occasions and reflective lenses for casual outings.
